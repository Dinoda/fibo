## Variables and attributes

### Naming



## Functions and methods

### Naming

The base is a `lowerCamelCase`.

All method and functions are supposed to be *verb* based naming, with a few exceptions (e.g. "constructor").

For deep implementation methods, "_" (underscore) tends to be used to prefix the method name.

#### Getters / Setters

Simple getters and setters are simply "getAttribute" and "setAttribute".

Some setters (mutators) tend to be simple like "addAttribute", "removeAttribute".
